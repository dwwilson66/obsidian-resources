I don't know how it slipped through during the whole time I was editing the video, but I create the notes at the end of each time frame rather than the beginning of them. For example, I would write my review for August on the last day of the month, the quarter during the last day, etc. I said I wrote them at the beginning, and idk where I got that from??? anyways enjoy and let me know if there's any issues :)
